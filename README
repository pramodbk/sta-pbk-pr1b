main.cpp			Top level file. Calling functions to read netlist and print timing information			
				* Read netlist
				* Topological sorting
				* Arrival time calculation
				* Required arrival time and Slack calculation		
	
ReadNetlist.hpp 		
ReadNetlist.cpp 		File to read netlist from file and function calls to generate netlistgraph
				* Trim input file and skip comments
				* Read and enter data to the netlist graph using "INPUT","OUTPUT" and "=" as keywords
				* NetlistGraph is passed as pointer to this function

node.hpp 			File containing node class definition.
node.cpp			Contains member functions to node class.
				* Gate respresentative class
				* Stores input and output connection info for each node as vector of node pointers.
			  	* Stores other basic information such as gate index and type
				* Has methods to calculate 
					** AT of a node, given input ATs
					** RAT of a node, given output RATs
					** Slack at a node

NetlistGraph.hpp 		File containing NetlistGraph (graph) classes.
NetlistGraph.cpp 		Includes member functions to NetlistGraph class.
				* Netlist graph class 
				* Stores list of nodes in the design by name and index. (constructed as a map)
				* Stores primary input/output and gate types in seperate vectors for easy accesibility
				* Has methods to generate the graph and printing to file. 
				* Has methods for levelization (toplogical sorting)
				* Has methods for calling node RAT/AT methods in the sorted order
